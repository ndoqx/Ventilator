# Emergency DIY Ventilator | Third-Year Embedded Project at KMITL

ðŸ”— GitHub Repository: [ndoqx/Ventilator](https://github.com/ndoqx/Ventilator)

This project is a DIY emergency ventilator system designed during my third year as a Biomedical Engineering student at KMITL. Built with Arduino Mega and a Cytron Motor Driver, the ventilator offers multiple breathing modes with customizable inspiration and expiration timing, making it a practical prototype for low-resource emergency support.

It reads a respiration rate input from a potentiometer and uses mode selection pins to determine the inspiration-to-expiration (I:E) ratio. The motor moves a mechanical piston or airbag to simulate natural breathing cycles, with safety checks via limit switches and LED feedback.

# Features

- Adjustable Respiratory Rate (RR) via potentiometer input
- Multiple I:E Ratio Modes using selector switches (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, etc.)
- Real-time calculation of inspiration and expiration timing
- Limit switches to detect motor endpoints and stop movement safely
- Onboard LED status and serial output for diagnostics
- Auto-stop safety if multiple modes are selected incorrectly
- Serial monitor output for real-time debugging

# How It Works

1. User selects a mode via a physical switch (M0 to M4).
2. Respiration Rate (RR) is read from an analog sensor (potentiometer).
3. The code calculates inTime and outTime based on the I:E ratio and RR.
4. Motor runs forward until it hits the min limit switch (inhale).
5. After `inTime` delay, the motor runs **backward** until max limit switch (exhale).
6. The cycle repeats while displaying real-time values to the serial monitor.

# Code Overview

Main logic is in `Ventilator_updated_check.ino`.  
Key functions include:

- `motorRun()`: Runs inhale/exhale cycle based on timing.
- `motorStop()`: Stops motor in case of invalid mode.
- `GetInExTime()`: Calculates inhale/exhale time.
- `loop()`: Continuously checks mode and runs the cycle.

# Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ndoqx/Ventilator.git
   cd Ventilator
````

2. Open `Ventilator_updated_check.ino` in Arduino IDE.

3. Select Board: Arduino Mega 2560, and connect via USB.

4. Upload the sketch and open Serial Monitor at `9600 baud`.

5. Observe real-time data and test the ventilator cycles.
